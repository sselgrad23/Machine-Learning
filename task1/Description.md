We read the training and testing data, excluding the "id" column, and store them in NumPy arrays.

We define a data preprocessing pipeline, which starts with a K-nearest neighbours imputer. This replaces missing values with estimates based on the values from the k-nearest neighbors of each data point.

Next, we apply standard scaling to the data, which scales the data features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Later, we select features with a variance greater than or equal to a certain threshold.

We also select features with a Pearson correlation coefficient greater than or equal to a specified p-value threshold.

After performing KNN imputation again, we detect outliers using the Isolation Forest method. It assigns an anomaly score to each data point, and those with high anomaly scores are considered outliers.

We use stacking to learn how to best combine the predictions of multiple models. The models we use in our stacking ensemble are XGBRegressor, LGBMRegressor, CatBoostRegressor, ExtraTreesRegressor, HistGradientBoostingRegressor, and GradientBoostingRegressor. 

Our final estimator that uses ExtraTreesRegressor makes the final prediction based on the predictions of the models in our ensemble. 

We perform k-fold cross-validation. For each fold, we calculate R-squared scores.

Finally, we use the trained model to make brain age predictions on the test data and save the predictions to a csv file.
