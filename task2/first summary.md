We first load data from 'X_train.csv' and 'y_train.csv' into Pandas DataFrames, 
create copies and NumPy arrays of the data, and extract labels into a list.

Data preprocessing:
We initialize empty lists to store autocorrelation, peak-to-peak distance, average, 
and FFT results for each sequence. We also get the number of sequences in the data array
and initialize an empty list to store the raw sequences.

For each sequence x in the numpy array we created from X_train.csv, we do the following 
data-preprocessing steps in order:
- Remove NaN values from x.s
- Store x in the signal_raw list.
- Convert x into a Pandas Series.
- Calculate autocorrelation from the Pandas series with a lag of 2 and append the result to the autocorr list.
- Calculate the average of x and append it to the avg list.
- Calculate the peak-to-peak distance and append it to the ptp list.
- Apply Fast Fourier Transform to x.
- Take the first 800 components of the FFT and store them in an array called "array".
- Get the indices of the top 15 frequency components in "array" and append them to the fft list.

Then, we convert the signal_raw list to a NumPy array, preserving object data type. Subsequently, we transform 
the autocorrelation, peak-to-peak, and average lists into NumPy arrays and transpose them. We also 
convert the fft list to a NumPy array.

The entries from X_train are of different length, so we have to pad them to the same length. To do this, we:
- Calculate the lengths of each sequence in signal_raw.
- Determine the maximum length among all sequences.
- For each signal in signal_raw, we pad each sequence with zeros to match the maximum length.

We create a new list new_seq with the padded sequences, and stack them to create the final NumPy array final_seq.
Then, we convert the final sequence array to a NumPy array signal_filtered, which represents the processed and 
padded sequences ready for further analysis or modeling.

Helper functions:
We define a function called safe_check that attempts to check if the value is finite using NumPy's np.isfinite function. If the value is finite, it is returned as is; otherwise, it returns np.nan (Not a Number). If there's a ValueError during the process, it also returns np.nan. The function aims to handle cases where the input value might not be a finite number, ensuring a safe operation.

For each ECG signal in signal_filtered, we do the following:
- We call the ecg function from the biosppy.signals module, providing the ECG signal (signal_raw[i]), the sampling rate (sampling_rate=300.0), and setting show to False to suppress any visualization.
- The function returns several elements such as the time axis (ts), filtered signal (filtered), R-peaks (rpeaks), template time axis (templates_ts), templates (templates), heart rate time axis (heart_rate_ts), and instantaneous heart rate (heart_rate).
- The extracted elements for each signal are appended to their respective lists.

Finally, the filtered_list is converted to a NumPy array and assigned back to signal_filtered.

We iterate through each template in templates_list, normalize it using a function called normalize, and append the result to a list named templates_normalized. We then calculate the mean and median of the normalized template and append the mean to a list named patients_heartbeats and the median to the patients_heartbeats_median list.

We iterate through each set of processed heartbeats for different patients (patients_heartbeats).
For each heartbeat in the patients_heartbeats list, we identify the R-peak (maximum point) and extracts points P, Q, S, and T based on specific criteria.
The extracted points are appended to their respective lists (P_list, Q_list, R_list, S_list, T_list).

These lists (P_list, Q_list, R_list, S_list, T_list) now contain the indices of the identified points for each patient's heartbeat.

Feature extraction: 
We now extract template features. First, we calculate intervals (PR, QRS, ST) between specific points (P, Q, R, S, T) in the ECG signals and compute the ratios of QRS duration to T and P intervals.

We also calculate amplitude characteristics including maximum amplitude (max_A), minimum amplitude (min_A), mean amplitude (mean_A), and median amplitude (median_A).
We also calculate statistics related to heart rates, including mean, median, standard deviation, and variance.
We also calculate statistics related to time intervals, including mean, median, standard deviation, and variance.
We also calculate statistics related to the detected peaks in the ECG signals, such as mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and the detection We also calculate statistics related to differences between consecutive peaks, such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
We then apply the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) using the Daubechies wavelet (db2) and extract the approximation and detail coefficients from all heartbeats in patients_heartbeats.
We then calculate the total energy of all signals and energy within a specific interval (from P to R).
We compute additional features related to amplitude, including the median and standard deviation of the amplitudes at R-peaks.
Finally, we reshape certain arrays (P_list and R_list).

We also extract RR interval (RRI) features. For all rpeaks in rpeaks_list, we compute the first and second derivatives of the RRI.
We also extract: 
- Skewness and kurtosis of RRI intervals (rri_skew, rri_kurtosis).
- Standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of the first derivative of RRI (diff_std, diff_skew, diff_kurtosis).
- Standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of the second derivative of RRI (diff2_std, diff2_skew, diff2_kurtosis).

Any NaN values are replaced with 0.0.

For RRI intervals (rri), first-order differences (d), and second-order differences (d2), we calculate sample entropy and multiscale entropy. Results are appended to lists.

For second-order differences (d2), we calculate Shannon entropy.
We check if the length of the sequences are greater than 1 before performing entropy calculations to avoid potential errors.
The safe_check function is used to handle potential errors in the entropy calculation. If there is an error (e.g., due to a sequence length less than 2), the value is set to 0.0. Any NaN values are replaced with 0.0.

We also extract whole wave features, including standard deviation, skew, and kurtosis. 

Feature assembly:
We create a data array with all the important extracted features. 

We use three base classifiers: XGBClassifier, LGBMClassifier, and GradientBoostingClassifier. With the preprocessed training data, we use NeverGrad to find the optimal hyperparameters for all three classifiers. We create a VotingClassifier using the three classifiers that are initialised with these optimal hyperparameters and uses soft or weighted voting. 

We train the ensemble model on the y_train and preprocessed x_train data. Finally, we make predictions on the preprocessed x_test data, and output the predictions in a csv file.
